# YashBot3001
Discord bot written with discord.py.

This is a discord bot made for fun.
If you fork the 'untested' branch of this repo, your token goes in a file called 'token.txt' in the same directory as the bot.py file, with no trailing whitespace. This is for security purposes.
Enjoy!
P.S. Join the [support server](https://discord.gg/hG6RDZz) if you have any issues! There you will find help from me and other volunteers. You can also add your own bot (on the support server) to test it and have others use it. You can also find help for coding your own bot.
