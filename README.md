# YashBot3001
Discord bot written with discord.py.
This is a discord bot made for fun.
If you use the code for yourself, make sure your token is stored in another file, preferably something called token.txt
Enjoy!
P.S. Join the support server (https://discord.gg/hG6RDZz) if you have any issues! There you will find help from me and other volunteers. You can also add your own bot (on the support server) to test it and have others use it. You can also find help for coding your own bot.
