# YashBot3001
Discord bot written with discord.py.
This is a discord bot made for fun.
if you go to the original repl.it (https://repl.it/@Nerdstep710/YashBot3001) and fork it, put your token in a file called .env - this is for security purposes. It must look like this: BOT_TOKEN=your_token_here.
Enjoy!
P.S. Join the testing server (https://discord.gg/hG6RDZz) if you have any issues! There you will find help from me and other volunteers.
